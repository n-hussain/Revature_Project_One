# Ground rules for numpy (applies to pandas too):
# 1. keep numpy in the service layer ONLY
#   - if you see numpy imports anywhere else, this is a design smell!
# 2. notice how methods take in books, and return normal datatypes NOT ndarrays
#   - this service and numpy are ISOLATED, this will keep our functions PURE and tests CLEAN
